Extends the [gallery] shortcode to be able to create galleries from image taxonomies or the featured images of specific Posts.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a variety of additional features to the core gallery shortcode that expand the options for specifying which images should be included in the gallery including the ability to create dynamic galleries of images that match a specific taxonomy "term". This is particularly useful when used in conjunction with the [PhotoPress - Image Taxonomies](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/photo-tools-image-taxonomies/) plugin which allows you to easily associate a wide variety of custom meta data with images.

Also, the plugin can be used to create gallery containing with the featured images of any Pages/Posts (even custom post types) that you specify. This is particularly useful when creating a "Gallery of Galleries" or any grouping of Posts that you want to be styled like your other galleries.

= Features Include: =

* Adds *"taxonomy"* and *"term"* gallery shortcode parameters.
* Adds *"caption_source"* parameter so that you can choose the source of text for your caption. Possible values are: "excerpt" (default), "title" (which pulls from the title), "none" (if you want no caption text).
* Adds *"post_type"* parameter for use in creating galleries of post types other than "image attachments". This parameter accepts any valid post type (e.g. "post", "page", etc.) including custom post types. If you use a post type other than 'attachment' then the featured image of the post will be used as the image icon in the gallery. This parameter can be combined with the "taxonomy" and "term" parameters as well.
* Adds six backwards compatible filters to the core gallery shortcode allowing plugin developers to control almost every aspect of the gallery HTML and CSS on a per gallery basis.
